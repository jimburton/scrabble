* Refactoring
** DONE Moving all move updates into one function in main
   CLOSED: [2021-03-02 Tue 13:50]
   Currently spread around updateScore, fillRack, toggleTurn etc. and 
   needs to be called from view (e.g. cli).

** TODO AI
   Keep a map of playable positions: Pos => (Letter, numspaces N, numspaces E, numspaces S,
   numspaces W).

   Ideal solution: 

   For each entry in the map, add the tile to the rack and get all suggestions. Pick the
   highest scoring one, making the list "Candidates".

   Play the highest scoring Candidate.

   Keep the map of playable positions up to date after each move.
*** DONE Basic word selection (max 6 letters, prefix and suffix only) and playing it on the board
    CLOSED: [2021-03-11 Thu 19:34]
*** TODO Select words with the playable position somewhere in the middle  
*** TODO Make it fast enough for longer words
*** TODO Handle blanks

*** TODO Updating playable positions:

    This is quite tricky...hard to see how to efficiently check whether you can add to the
    beginning or end of words in the same direction.

    For positions that are part of horizontally placed words, get the distance between
    the pos and the edge of the board or two spaces before an occupied tile, whichever is
    closer. Vive versa for vertical words...

*** TODO Help message
*** TODO allow temp tiles on board to be dragged and dropped
* Bugs
** TODO Prune playable positions after each move.

** DONE fillRack
   CLOSED: [2021-03-02 Tue 11:22]
** DONE move not handling new two letter words correctly

** DONE Handle bad input nicely in CLI
   CLOSED: [2021-03-11 Thu 18:18]

** DONE Too many blanks appearing in the bag
   CLOSED: [2021-03-11 Thu 18:14]
   Possibly other letters too but the blanks stand out.

** AI
*** TODO Managing playable positions properly
Currently the AI crashes due to garbage playable positions and running out of playable
positions when really there should be some available.

*** TODO Enable AI to play with blanks
*** TODO Make the AI swap tiles instead of passing the move when it can't find a word.  
*** DONE AI selecting words that include non-dictionary additional words
   CLOSED: [2021-03-11 Thu 19:33]


** Web
*** TODO Web client: can't swap blanks?
*** TODO Web client: drag and drop temp tiles on board
*** TODO Additional words picking substrings of the main word
   Happens (at least) if you play a horizontal word ending on an existing one.

*** TODO Web client not registering old tiles as part of new word. 
Sending everything but existing tiles to the server.

* Testing

** TODO Play one AI player against another.
And make sure the game is played to a conclusion, hopefully not ending by two passes in a row.

Examples of removing nasty record updates

Scrabble.Game.Internal.setScore
if turn g == P1
then let s' = score (player1 g) in
       pure g { player1 = (player1 g) {score = s' + s} }
else let s' = score (player2 g) in
       pure g { player2 = (player2 g) {score = s' + s} }

becomes

pure $ g & getPlayer g . score %~ (+s)

in updatePlayer

>>= \g' -> pure (g' { bag = theBag', gen = theGen'})

becomes

>>= \g' -> pure (g' & bag .~ theBag' & gen .~ theGen')

endGame :: Game -> Evaluator Game
endGame g = do
  let r1v = rackValue (rack (player1 g))
      r2v = rackValue (rack (player2 g))
      p1s = (score (player1 g) - r1v) + r2v
      p2s = (score (player2 g) - r2v) + r1v
  pure g { player1 = (player1 g) { score = p1s }
         , player2 = (player2 g) { score = p2s }

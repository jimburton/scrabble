   Keep a map of playable positions: Pos => (Letter, numspaces N, numspaces E, numspaces S,
   numspaces W).

   Ideal solution: 

   For each entry in the map, add the tile to the rack and get all suggestions. Pick the
   highest scoring one, making the list "Candidates".

   Play the highest scoring Candidate.

   Keep the map of playable positions up to date after each move.
*** TODO Basic word selection (max 6 letters, prefix and suffix only) and playing it on the board
*** TODO Select words with the playable position somewhere in the middle  
*** TODO Make it fast enough for longer words
*** TODO Handle blanks

*** TODO Selecting playable positions:

    This is quite tricky...hard to see how to efficiently check whether you can add to the
    beginning or end of words in the same direction.

    For positions that are part of horizontally placed words, get the distance between
    the pos and the edge of the board or two spaces before an occupied tile, whichever is
    closer. Vive versa for vertical words...

# ScrabbÎ»e

A one- or two-player implementation of Scrabble for teaching functional programming at the 
University of Brighton. It consists of a core library, and two clients (web and CLI) for playing
the game.

The Scrabble library is inspired by https://github.com/joshcough/Scrabble.

If you don't know the rules of the game you should begin by reading
them
[here](https://www.theukrules.co.uk/rules/children/games/scrabble.html). 

The emphasis is on explaining the process of developing a Haskell
project with several parts, aimed at students who have already learned
Haskell syntax and functional problem solving. Commonly used data
structures and libraries like `Data.Text`, maps, arrays, `aeson` and
`lens` are explained, as well as monadic error checking and building a
WebSocket client to the game that shows how to use threads and other
concurrency abstractions safely.

Each chapter refines the initial solution, ending up with something
that is (hopefully) a clean, functional design that can easily be
extended.

Testing is a continuous topic, so new tests are added in each chapter.

+ [Chapter One](chapters/Chapter1.md): Getting started.
+ [Chapter Two](chapters/Chapter2.md): Players and the game.
+ [Chapter Three](chapters/Chapter3.md): Validating moves.
+ [Chapter Four](chapters/Chapter4.md): Playing the game.
+ [Chapter Five](chapters/Chapter5.md): Playing against the computer.
+ [Chapter Six](chapters/Chapter6.md): The CLI client.
+ [Chapter Seven](chapters/Chapter7.md): The web server and client.
+ [Chapter Eight](chapters/Chapter8.md): Configuration and conclusion.

## Having a quick game

There are two front ends to try out the game. Each of which allows you
to play against the computer or against another person. Start a game
in the terminal like this:

```
$ cabal run scrabble
Enter 1P or 2P
1p
Enter name of player
bob

To start a web-based game you need to start the server then start one
or two clients. Start the server with `cabal run
scrabble-server`. Then start the first client by opening
`web/client/html/index.html` in a browser. Select the checkbox 
for a one-player game or leave it unchecked and open the page again in another 
tab for a two player game.

If you want to run clients on a network, start the client server with
`cabal run scrabble-client`. This serves the web client on 
http://localhost:8000/index.html. To change the hostname, port, etc, see
`/etc/scrabble.conf`.

# ScrabbÎ»e

A one- or two-player implementation of Scrabble for teaching functional programming at the 
University of Brighton. It consists of a core library, and two clients (web and CLI) for playing
the game.

The Scrabble library is inspired by https://github.com/joshcough/Scrabble.

If you don't know the rules of the game you should begin by reading
them
[here](https://www.theukrules.co.uk/rules/children/games/scrabble.html). 

The emphasis is on explaining the process of developing a Haskell
project with several parts, aimed at students who have already learned
Haskell syntax and functional problem solving. Commonly used data
structures and libraries like `Data.Text`, maps, arrays and `aeson`
are explained, as well as monadic error checking and building a
WebSocket client to the game that shows how to use threads and other
concurrency abstractions safely.

Each chapter refines the initial solution, ending up with something
that is (hopefully) a clean, functional design that can easily be
extended.

Testing is a continuous topic, so new tests are added in each chapter.

+ [Chapter One](chapters/Chapter1.md): Getting started.
+ [Chapter Two](chapters/Chapter2.md): Players and the game.
+ [Chapter Three](chapters/Chapter3.md): Validating moves.
+ [Chapter Four](chapters/Chapter4.md): Playing the game.
+ [Chapter Five](chapters/Chapter5.md): Playing against the computer.
+ [Chapter Six](chapters/Chapter6.md): The CLI client.
+ [Chapter Seven](chapters/Chapter7.md): The web server and client.
+ [Chapter Eight](chapters/Chapter8.md): Configuration and conclusion.

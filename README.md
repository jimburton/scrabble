# Scrabble

An multiplayer implementation of Scrabble for teaching functional programming at the 
University of Brighton. It consists of a core library, and two clients (web and CLI) for playing
the game.

The Scrabble library is (heavily) adapted from https://github.com/joshcough/Scrabble.

If you don't know the rules of the game you should begin by reading
them
[here](https://www.theukrules.co.uk/rules/children/games/scrabble.html). 

The emphasis is intended to be on explaining the process of developing
a Haskell project with several parts, aimed at students who have
already learned the basics of Haskell syntax and functional problem
solving. As well as adding new functionality, each chapter refines the
initial solution ending up with something that is (hopefully) a clean,
functional design that can easily be extended. 

Testing is a continuous topic, so new tests are added in each chapter.

+ [Chapter One](chapters/Chapter1.md): Getting started.
+ [Chapter Two](chapters/Chapter2.md): Validating moves.
+ [Chapter Three](chapters/Chapter3.md): Playing the game.
+ [Chapter Four](chapters/Chapter4.md): Playing against the computer.
+ [Chapter Five](chapters/Chapter5.md): The CLI client.
+ [Chapter Six](chapters/Chapter6.md): The web client.
+ [Chapter Seven](chapters/Chapter7.md): Conclusion.

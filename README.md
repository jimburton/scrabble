# Scrabble

An multiplayer implementation of Scrabble for teaching functional programming at the 
University of Brighton. It consists of a core library, and two clients (web and CLI) for playing
the game.

The Scrabble library is (heavily) adapted from https://github.com/joshcough/Scrabble.

If you don't know the rules of the game you should begin by reading
them
[here](https://www.theukrules.co.uk/rules/children/games/scrabble.html). 

The emphasis is intended to be on explaining the basics of Haskell
development and on refining an initial solution to a clean, functional
software design that can easily be extended. Testing is a continuous
topic, so new tests are added in each chapter.
